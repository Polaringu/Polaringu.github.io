Hi! My name is Alex. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 10 years of professional experience in software development for commercial projects that include deep work with PDF format, structure, algorithms, batch-processing, multi-tasking and UI/UX. 

And this is my simple coding blog where I share some stuff that I wrote down for better memorizing.
